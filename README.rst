buildout-base
=============

Generic zc.buildout base config files, which can be used by different projects,
at least by me. Currently very Zope/Plone based, but support for Django or the
like will likely come.

TODO
====

* etc/deliverance.cfg
  - deliverance-init: path to input file not accessible when refering via http
  - rules-file is project specific.
